# My Layout Comprehension Project

This is a simple webpage created to demonstrate fundamental CSS layout techniques. The project was completed as part of a course to test my knowledge of using CSS to structure a webpage.

## Project Description

The goal of this project was to build a basic webpage layout with a clear structure. The layout includes a:

* **Header:** Contains the site title and a navigation bar.
* **Main Content Area:** The primary section for the page's content.
* **Sidebar:** A supplementary section alongside the main content.
* **Footer:** The bottom section of the page with copyright information.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5:** For the page structure and semantic elements.
* **CSS3:** For styling and, most importantly, for the layout.

## Layout Approach

The main layout of this project was built using **CSS Flexbox**. Flexbox was chosen for its efficiency in creating a simple, responsive two-column layout for the main content and sidebar.
